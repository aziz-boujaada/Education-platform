                                <p>In this video, Hitesh introduces the basics of HTML
                                    (Hypertext Markup Language), one of the most essential elements of web
                                    <br> development.
                                    He explains the simple structure of an HTML document, which is divided
                                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains
                                    metadata,<br>
                                    such as the document title, while the body contains visible content like
                                    headings (h1) and paragraphs. <br>
                                    Hitesh also discusses the use of VS Code and its Emmet abbreviation
                                    shortcuts to quickly generate HTML boilerplate code,<br>
                                    making development more efficient. He walks through the creation of a
                                    basic webpage, covering elements like the doctype, <br>
                                    which declares the version of HTML5, and the title and h1 tags.
                                    Additionally, Hitesh highlights the importance of writing semantic HTML
                                    <br>
                                    that works across various platforms, including screen readers and
                                    in-flight entertainment systems, ensuring accessibility and cross-device
                                    <br>compatibility.
                                    The video provides a strong foundation for understanding HTML structure
                                    and paves the way for exploring more advanced tags and web development
                                    techniques <br>
                                    in upcoming lessons. It's an excellent introduction for anyone starting
                                    with web development or frontend design.

                                <p>In this video, Hitesh introduces the basics of HTML
                                    (Hypertext Markup Language), one of the most essential elements of web
                                    <br> development.
                                    He explains the simple structure of an HTML document, which is divided
                                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains
                                    metadata,<br>
                                    such as the document title, while the body contains visible content like
                                    headings (h1) and paragraphs. <br>
                                    Hitesh also discusses the use of VS Code and its Emmet abbreviation
                                    shortcuts to quickly generate HTML boilerplate code,<br>
                                    making development more efficient. He walks through the creation of a
                                    basic webpage, covering elements like the doctype, <br>
                                    which declares the version of HTML5, and the title and h1 tags.
                                    Additionally, Hitesh highlights the importance of writing semantic HTML
                                    <br>
                                    that works across various platforms, including screen readers and
                                    in-flight entertainment systems, ensuring accessibility and cross-device
                                    <br>compatibility.
                                    The video provides a strong foundation for understanding HTML structure
                                    and paves the way for exploring more advanced tags and web development
                                    techniques <br>
                                    in upcoming lessons. It's an excellent introduction for anyone starting
                                    with web development or frontend design.

                                    <br> development.
                                    He explains the simple structure of an HTML document, which is divided
                                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head contains
                                    metadata,<br>
                                    such as the document title, while the body contains visible content like
                                    headings (h1) and paragraphs. <br>
                                    Hitesh also discusses the use of VS Code and its Emmet abbreviation
                                    shortcuts to quickly generate HTML boilerplate code,<br>
                                    making development more efficient. He walks through the creation of a
                                    basic webpage, covering elements like the doctype, <br>
                                    which declares the version of HTML5, and the title and h1 tags.
                                    Additionally, Hitesh highlights the importance of writing semantic HTML
                                    <br>
                                    that works across various platforms, including screen readers and
                                    in-flight entertainment systems, ensuring accessibility and cross-device
                                    <br>compatibility.
                                    The video provides a strong foundation for understanding HTML structure
